## Hi there, I'm **Felipe**!

At just nine years old in 2008, I fell head-over-heels in love with programming, and that passion has only grown stronger over time. Starting with the creation of Flash games for my friends in ActionScript, I soon expanded my horizons to explore a variety of domains, including web development, game development, Java, Python, C#, and other general-purpose languages. My love for programming has driven me to become well-versed in numerous programming languages and software architecture principles. These skills allow me to solve real-world problems and develop innovative solutions that make a difference. As a driven and dedicated individual, I am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies and methodologies in the ever-evolving tech industry.
