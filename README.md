## Hi there, I'm **Felipe**!

I started studying programming in 2008, at the age of nine, with the goal of creating games in Flash and ActionScript. I felt in love with programming and never stopped learning. I have knowledge in several programming languages and software architecture principles. I have participated in several competitions in robotics, competitive programming and game development (which is my favorite hobby by the way). I have two cats (MyelinðŸ˜º and Voxel ðŸ˜¸).

- I am a Jr Full Stack Developer @ [ItaÃº Unibanco](https://www.itau.com/)
- I'm studying Computer Science @ [UFABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/en/)
- I've already worked as a Data Analyst, but currently I want to evolve as a Developer
